\usage{
mapper1D(
  distance_matrix = dist(data.frame(x = 2 * cos(0.5 * (1:100)), y = sin(1:100))),
  filter_values = 2 * cos(0.5 * (1:100)),

}
\arguments{
\item{distance_matrix}{An n x n matrix of pairwise dissimilarities.}

\item{filter_values}{A length n vector of real numbers.}

\item{num_intervals}{A positive integer.}

\item{percent_overlap}{A number between 0 and 100 specifying how much adjacent intervals should overlap.}

\item{num_bins_when_clustering}{A positive integer that controls whether points in the same level set end up in the same cluster.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{TDAmapper} which is a list of items named \code{adjacency} (adjacency matrix for the edges), \code{num_vertices} (integer number of vertices), \code{level_of_vertex} (vector with \code{level_of_vertex[i]} = index of the level set for vertex i), \code{points_in_vertex} (list with \code{points_in_vertex[[i]]} = vector of indices of points in vertex i), \code{points_in_level} (list with \code{points_in_level[[i]]} = vector of indices of points in level set i, and \code{vertices_in_level} (list with \code{vertices_in_level[[i]]} = vector of indices of vertices in level set i.
}
\description{
This function uses a filter function f: X -> R on a data set X that has n rows (observations) and k columns (variables).
